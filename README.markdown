This is my vim setup
Using NERDTree, FuzzyFileFinderTextmate, and Ack plugins

Need to run these commands as well (assuming ruby and rubygems are installed):

sudo apt-get install ack-grep && ln -s /usr/bin/ack-grep /usr/bin/ack
sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
sudo gem install jamis-fuzzy_file_finder
